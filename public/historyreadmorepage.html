        <h2>History of Traveling Locations in Sri Lanka</h2>
        <h3>Polonnaruwa Vatadage, Polonnaruwa Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Polonnaruwa Vatadage is a well-preserved Vatadage in the famous Dalada
          Maluwa quadrangle of the ancient city of ruins, Polonnaruwa. Vatadages
          are typical Buddhist structures found in Sri Lanka. These are
          circular, constructed using stone and brick with intricate stone
          carvings and a wooden roof. They were built to protect stupas.
          Currently, there are ten Vatadages in Sri Lanka, and the most popular
          one is Polonnaruwa Vatadage. This structure is built in Buddulakara or
          bubble-shaped design and is the perfect example of a typical Sri
          Lankan Vatadage. The upper part of the structure has been destroyed;
          only the lower part remains. Many theories revolve around the
          construction of this monument, but most historians agree to the
          hypothesis that it was built by Parakramabahu I in the 12th century.
          The Vatadage was initially constructed to protect the tooth relic of
          Buddha and his ten commandments. Buddhists believe that Buddha’s left
          canine remained even after his cremation, and the country has
          preserved this relic as their prized possession. This tooth, which was
          the reason for the construction of Polonnaruwa Vatadage, is now placed
          in the Temple of Kandy. The Vatadage protects a small stupa of 8
          inches. The structure has two platforms - an upper platform and a
          lower one. The lower platform is 120 feet in diameter and 4 feet in
          height, while the top platform is 80 feet in diameter and 5 feet in
          height. The centre of the top platform has four Buddhist statues in
          dhyana mudra in sitting position. The four figures are 5 feet tall and
          face the four cardinal directions. This architecture makes the
          Vatadage a very typical one, with a charm of its own. The structure
          and its surroundings emit positivity and are extremely inviting for
          tourists.

        <h2>Unique Information About Traveling in Sri Lanka</h2>
        <h3>Anuradhapura Tourism</h3>
        <p>
          Anuradhapura is a historical paradise as it houses several heritage
          monasteries, palaces and monuments. It is known for its vast dagobas
          or brick stupas, ancient ponds and pools and magnificent temples. The
          city was established as the first capital of Sri Lanka in 377 BC. It
          was also at this time that Anuradhapura rose to prominence as a seat
          of political and economic importance. Anuradhapura was built around a
          cut piece from the Bodhi Tree, or the 'tree of enlightenment', which
          is considered sacred by Buddhists. This city was on the peak of
          political and religious activities for around 900 years. It was
          invaded in 998 AD, after which it lost its importance. After being
          overlooked for several years, this World Heritage Site is now
          accessible again. Currently, Anuradhapura is an important religious
          site and a popular tourist attraction. Apart from the Dagobas, the
          most popular tourist attractions in Anuradhapura are its ruins, or
          Anuradhapura World Heritage Site, the scared Maha Bodhi tree,
          Lovamahapaya or Brazen Palace, Archeological museum, Isurumuniya
          Vihara or rock temple, Ratna Prasada or jewel palace, Royal Pleasure
          Gardens, Kuttam Pokuna or ponds, Buddha's samadhi, Royal Palace and
          many more. Amongst the well-known dagobas are Mirisaveti, Ruwanveli,
          Abhayagiri, Jetavanarama, Thuparama, Lankarama, and many more.
          Interestingly, the monasteries in Anuradhapura occupy a whopping 16
          square miles by area. With this, it is evident that Anuradhapura is
          culturally and religiously significant to an unimaginable extent.
          Authentic Buddhist traditions, archaeological ruins, lavish palaces,
          traditional monasteries and informative museums define the grandeur of
          Anuradhapura. Even though it is a large town, Anuradhapura gives the
          feel of being in a village. With its well preserved cultural sites,
          ponds and monuments, Anuradhapura is a well-established tourist
          attraction in Sri Lanka. Tourists visit this town for a rejuvenating
          getaway, to seek peace and to satiate their inquisitiveness.
