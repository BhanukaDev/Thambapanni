        <h1>Sri Lankan Culture</h1>
        <p>
          Sri Lankan culture is known for its regional diversity and mixes
          modern elements with traditional aspects. Sri Lankan culture has long
          been influenced by the heritage of Theravada Buddhism passed on from
          India, and the religion's legacy is particularly strong in Sri Lanka's
          southern and central regions. South Indian cultural influences are
          especially pronounced in the northernmost reaches of the country. The
          history of colonial occupation has also left a mark on Sri Lanka's
          identity, with Portuguese, Dutch, and British elements having
          intermingled with various traditional facets of Sri Lankan culture.
          Additionally, Indonesian culture has also influenced certain aspects
          of Sri Lankan culture. Culturally, Sri Lanka possesses strong links to
          both India and Southeast Asia. Sri Lanka is a land of great cultural
          diversity. Religion pervades many aspects of life and constitutes a
          basic element of this diversity. Buddhist and Hindu temples, as well
          as mosques and churches, with their own colourful rituals, are the
          most readily visible features of the cultural landscape. Here are some
          things to know about Sri Lanka's local culture: - Sri Lanka is a
          multi-ethnic and multi-religious country. - The majority of people in
          Sri Lanka are Buddhists. - The Sinhalese people are the largest ethnic
          group in Sri Lanka. - The Tamil people are the second-largest ethnic
          group in Sri Lanka. - The official languages of Sri Lanka are Sinhala
          and Tamil. - Rice and curry is the staple food in Sri Lanka. - Tea is
          one of the most important exports from Sri Lanka. - Cricket is the
          most popular sport in Sri Lanka. - The traditional dress for women in
          Sri Lanka is the sari. - The traditional dress for men in Sri Lanka is
          the sarong.

            Also known as Poson Paya, this is the second most important one amongst festivals celebrated in Sri Lanka by the Buddhists. Since it commemorates the advent of Buddhism in the island in the 3rd century, Poson Festival holds great historical significance too. Just as in Vesak, the celebrations include lanterns, pandals, and alms-stalls across the island in the true spirit of the Buddhist traditions and teachings. The grandest festivities are in and around Mihintale rock outcrop where Buddha's disciple Mahinda first preached Buddhist doctrines to King Devanampiyatissa.
